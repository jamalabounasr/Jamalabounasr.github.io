I’m Jamal Abounasr, a researcher with the <a href="https://rflex.upc.edu/en" target="_blank">RFLEX</a> (Radio Frequency Identification & Flexible Electronics) group at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya <a href="https://www.upc.edu/ca" target="_blank">(UPC)</a>. 

My work focuses on wearable and body-integrated RF sensing, including printed and textile antenna sensors for respiratory monitoring and other biomedical applications. I design RF structures and validate them experimentally, bridging electromagnetics, flexible fabrication, and signal interpretation to turn RF measurements into meaningful physiological information.

## Research Interests
- Wearable and body-integrated RF sensing for healthcare
- Textile and printed antenna-based sensors for respiratory monitoring
- Flexible fabrication (embroidered e-textiles, printed conductors) and reliability (washing/stretching)
- Near-field coupling / resonator-based sensing and RF readout interpretation
- Signal processing and calibration against reference systems (e.g., BIOPAC)
